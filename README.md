### Action taken
1. Check you have python3 installed `python3 --version` in terminal 
2. Clone repo 
3. Inside that repo run `python3 -m venv venv`  this creates a new virtual enviroment. Read about virtual enviroments [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) They basically are used to manage the versions of your python and python packages.

4. Run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the venv
5. Run `pip install django` to install the django package. pip is the python package manager read about it [here](https://pypi.org/)
6. Change into the nested 'mysite' folder with `cd mysite`
7. Run `python manage.py runserver`
8. In your browser go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ you should see a page that says *The install worked successfully! Congratulations!*

9. Press `ctrl + c` to stop server.
10. Enter `deactivate` to exit venv
